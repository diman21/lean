<h2>Whatis lean</h2>
<p>
    What began as the idea to bring Controller/Action functionality to the <a href="http://slimframework.com">Slim micro
    framework</a>,
    is now a simple yet powerful PHP5.3 micro lib to create full fledged web applications on top of Slim.
</p>
<p>
    lean has lots of components that will help you on your way to a great website even without using slim or the lean
    Application class, have a look!

            <p>
                This woman had to deal with monolithic frameworks!<br/>
                She should've used lean instead and saved herself a good deal of trouble!
